	<p>R[Ag]e Metals accepts Venmo, PayPal F&F, Cash, Checks, and Bitcoin. Each method of payment has it's own handling
		terms and conditions. Orders larger than 5 troy ounces must be paid in advance. No amount due is final until the
		moment before shipping.</p>

	<p>PayPal and Venmo payments for an order under 5ozt can be sent before or after pouring. This is solely up to you.
		If
		you are more involved in your pieces it is recommended that you send your payment after your products are
		poured.
		Products will be shipped once the funds have been transfered to our bank account.</p>

	<p>Cash and Check payments must be received and cleared before your order is shipped. Details on where to mail your
		check or cash will be provided at the time of payment. These payments cost an additional 3% for handling fees.
	</p>

	<p>Bitcoin payments must be made within 10 minutes of the agreed purchase. When the funds are received and verified
		your order will begin its process of creation or shipping.</p>

	<p>You are liable for all payments. We are not responsible if your payment is lost in the mail or stolen.</p>
	<p>Spot Price is defined as the current price of said precious metals at the time of purchase. We pull spot prices from APMEX.</p>
