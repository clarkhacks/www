<div class="editable">

    <p>R[Ag]e Metals holds no liability if your package is lost, stolen, or damaged. All packages sent through USPS are
        insured, this should be handled with your local postmaster. </p>

    <p>However, in the event this does happen to you we may be able to help. Being a small company means we cannot just
        throw money at a problem. We have other means of helping out though.</p>

    <p>A piece of silver could've been left out of a package and can be identified in our work area by its serial
        number. If this is the case we will ship it directly to you at our own expense.</p>

    <p>
        If you can prove your package was stolen we cannot offer a replacement at this time but can offer discounts to
        help ease the burden. Hopefully, soon we will be a large enough business to help out more in these situations.
        Everyone working at R[Ag]e Metals has had a package stolen and we know it's an inraging and saddening loss.</p>
